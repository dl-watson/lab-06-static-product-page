# lab-06-static-product-page

current goals:

- selecting quantity 0 in the cart quantity dropdown removes the item from your cart

- refactor and reorganize code (current state of renderView functions make me want to scream)

- better solution for not-found image added from admin panel

- checkout click readout needs the dynamic value of the cart array

---

STRETCH remove a product;

on the product entry page, also render a list of products with a remove button by each one.

add a function removeProduct that takes a product code. In that method, find the product and remove from the product array.

use this function to remove an item on an appropriate click;

BONUS: When adding a product, also renderer a new list items add it to the list of products.
