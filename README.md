# lab-06-static-product-page

current goals:

- selecting quantity 0 in the cart quantity dropdown removes the item from your cart

- more consistent styling: 

    > header with navigation links

    > cart navigation with logo (animation?) in the nav bar 

- refactor and reorganize code (current state of renderView functions make me want to scream)
